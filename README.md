# Web Portfolio Template

Welcome to the Beginner's Web Portfolio Template! This project was cloned from the [PortfolioWebsite]( https://github.com/ScrumMasterSequoia/PortfolioWebsite), generously permitted by [Sequoia Kanies](https://github.com/ScrumMasterSequoia) to be used as a stepping stone for budding developers to kickstart their own portfolio site.

The template is a minimalist yet powerful web project primarily built with HTML and CSS and good old vanilla JavaScript. It serves as a central hub, showcasing images, information, and links to various projects and files. It's an excellent platform for new developers to practice and enhance their HTML, CSS and JS skills.

One of the key features of this template is its interactive color mode, implemented using JavaScript. Users can personalize the color scheme of the site by simply clicking on one of the colored dots at the top of the DOM (Document Object Model). This feature not only adds a touch of personalization but also provides a practical example of DOM manipulation using JavaScript. Please add more color schemes to your version of the project and add new features and styles. Look into attaching shadows to your HTML elements by adding shadow variables in your CSS or by adding a shadow class in html.

So, whether you're looking to create a personal portfolio or just want to get your hands dirty with some HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this template is a great place to start!

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the repository from GitHub. You can do this by clicking the 'Fork' button at the top right corner of the repository page.

2. **Clone the Repository**: After forking, clone the repository to your local machine. You can do this with the following command:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/PortfolioWebsite.git
    ```

    Alternatively, VSCode allows you to clone repos by URL from the welcome page

3. **Install Live Server Extension**: To run the project locally, install the Live Server extension in VSCode. Once installed, it appears in the bottom right corner of the VSCode window. Right click your index.html file and open with Live Server

## Deployment

We recommend deploying the website on Netlify. Then your website will be live and on a secure HTTPS link. Follow these steps:

1. **Create a Netlify Account**: If you don't have one, create a new account on Netlify.

2. **New Site from Git**: Click on 'New site from Git' on the dashboard.

3. **Connect to GitHub**: Choose GitHub for Continuous Deployment.

4. **Choose Your Forked Repo**: Select the forked repository to deploy.

5. **Deploy Site**: Click on 'Deploy Site'. Netlify will start the build and deploy process.

## Updating the Website

To update the live hosted version of the website, use the source control tab (VSCode) and commit the changes to GitHub so that Netlify can auto-deploy for you. (you must set up continuous deployment)
We recommend that your projects hosted herein have links to the live hosted projects (netlify or otherwise)

**Pro Tip**: If you make an update and don't see any changes, sometimes you must clear your browsing cookies, data, etc. to avoid reloading outdated file attributes.
